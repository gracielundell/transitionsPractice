CSS practice with transitions

###By Gracie Lundell

##Description
Created as a means to practice CSS transitions, this site is an "ocean experience". Transitions are used in the form of rows and columns of semi-hexagonal shapes growing and shrinking acoss the page in a rhythmic transition. To follow, a wave of color moves in the same horizontal fashion back and forth across the page, changing from tan, to white, to blue in a way that simulates an ocean lapping its shore. This cohesion of movement creates a feeling of calm for its viewers, providing a busy mind a sense of tranquility and ease.

##Setup
To view this webpage and the code behind it, clone this repository. Then open it using the text editor of your choice. Once opened, drag the <code>index.html</code> tab into the header of your web browser. Sit back, and enjoy.
